# GoldCave

The purpose of this program is to find which combination of the gold nuggets has the most weight without going over the limit.
The way that it is done is by finding every single combination and comparing it to each other. There is a temp storage that hold the
current weight. If there is a combination that weights more than that is switch out. Right now I'm trying to have the program run faster 
since it takes a long time in a situation where there is 40 gold nuggets.
